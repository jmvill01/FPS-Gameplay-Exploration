# FPS-Gameplay-Exploration
by Joel villamor

This project represents my exploration into the development of gameplay engineering practices. 
With many hours put into this project, I've replicated a series of gameplay mechanics as seen in 
modern FPS gameplay titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare I & II.

These mechanics are as follows:

1. A common fps controller (jump included)
2. Wall mount (a jump to the top of a high ledge)
3. Weapon Firing Mechanism
4. Aim Down Sights Capabilities
5. Character Slide
6. Character Crouch/Sprint
7. Character Dive

These mechanics range from basic to higher quality implementations. With some content taken from
tutorials and online resources I want to thank the sourced videos and sites that helped me to
create and explore with the gameplay engineering role.

Controls:
- W . A . S . D -> General player controls
- MOUSE LEFT    -> Fire weapon
- MOUSE RIGHT   -> Aim down sights
- SPACE         -> Jump
- SHIFT         -> Sprint
- C             -> Crouch/Stand
- SHIFT + C     -> Slide
- SHIFT + F     -> Dive

This was an absolute joy to make.
